# ClariWeaveAI

**Unweaving Mental Chaos into Multimodal Clarity.**

ClariWeaveAI is a premium, real-time multimodal mental wellness agent designed to transform overwhelming thoughts and visual clutter into actionable micro-hits of clarity. Guided by **Clara** (powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio**), it orchestrates a specialized mesh of agents to provide a seamless, empathic interaction across voice, image, and text.

## 🌍 Live Deployment

ClariWeave AI is live on Google Cloud Run:
**[View Live App](https://clariweave-agent-1066883661243.us-central1.run.app)**

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multimodal Uplink**: Simultaneous processing of audio (emotions/transcript) and video/images (visual context).
- **Agent Mesh Architecture**: Modularized backend with specialized agents (Weaver, Guardian, Archivist, Linguist, Analyst) coordinated by Clara.
- **Robust Voice Control**: Advanced "Stop/Shutdown" detection with interim analysis for near-instant response.
- **Media Persistence**: Visual gallery of recent uploads and analysis history.
- **Mind Mesh Visualizer**: Real-time graph showing agent collaboration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- [Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Installation & Running

1. **Setup Environment**:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root and add your `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

2. **Run Locally**:
   The easiest way to start both services:
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```

### 🛠️ Utilities (Verification)
We provide several scripts in `scripts/` to verify your environment and API access:
- `python scripts/verify_models.py`: List all available Gemini models.
- `python scripts/verify_live.py`: Test the Multimodal Live API connection.
- `python scripts/discover_api.py`: Inspect the GenAI SDK capabilities.

## ⚖️ Reproducible Testing Guide for Judges

To verify the core engine and multimodal capabilities of ClariWeave AI, please follow this step-by-step testing script:

### 1. Verification of Live Uplink
Visit the [Live Deployment](https://clariweave-agent-1066883661243.us-central1.run.app) and ensure the "Infrastructure Status" shows **Uplink Active**.

### 2. Live Orchestration Test
1.  Navigate to the **System Logs** tab.
2.  Speak to Clara: *"Hey Clara, help me unweave my mental clutter."*
3.  Observe the **Real-time Orchestration** panel. You should see trails for `rag_search_history` and `extract_session_metrics` appear live as she processes your request.

### 3. Multimodal Insight Test
1.  Switch to the **Upload** tab and select an image or short video of a cluttered workspace.
2.  Wait for the **Hybrid Analysis** to complete.
3.  Clara will proactively interrupt the session to narrate insights about the clutter she observed, mapping it to your mental energy levels.

### 4. Local Reproduction (Optional)
If you wish to run the engine locally:
1.  `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
2.  `npm install --prefix frontend`
3.  `python start.py`
4.  Standard tests are available via `pytest backend/tests`.

## 🧠 The Story behind ClariWeaveAI

### 💡 Inspiration
In an era of hyper-productivity, we often face "Mental Overhang"—the paralysis that comes from an messy desk, a cluttered screen, and a racing mind. We wanted to build more than a chatbot; we wanted a **Grounded Companion** that can see your environment and hear your heart, gently unweaving chaos into clarity.

### 🏗️ How we built it
- **Orchestration**: Built with the **Google ADK**, we created a decentralized "Agent Mesh" where Clara (the Coordinator) delegates specialized tasks to 5 distinct agent personas.
- **Multimodal Grounding**: We use **Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio** for near-zero latency vocal comfort, coupled with visual frame analysis to verify the user's physical environment.
- **Reactive UI**: The frontend uses **Framer Motion** and **Tailwind 4** to create a "Living Hologram" that reacts to the user's emotional state in real-time.

### 🚧 Challenges we ran into
- **Audio Precision**: Handling raw Float32 to Int16 PCM conversion in the browser required a custom `AudioWorklet` to satisfy the Live API's strict 16kHz requirement.
- **Asynchronous Harmony**: Orchestrating REST-based image analysis with real-time WebSocket audio without breaking "The Engine" was a significant engineering hurdle we solved using a hybrid threadpool approach.

### 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- **Emotion-Grounded Hologram**: Creating a visual feedback loop where Clara "breathes" with the user.
- **Mind Mesh Transparency**: Building a visualizer that shows *exactly* how the agents are collaborating, turning the "black box" of AI into a "Glass Box."

### 📖 What we learned
We learned that the future of AI isn't just about answering questions—it's about **Proactive Empathy**. By combining vision and audio, Gemini can detect subtle environmental stressors that a user might not even realize are affecting them.

### 🔮 What's next for ClariWeaveAI
- **Biometric Integration**: Connecting to wearable devices for deeper heart-rate based grounding.
- **Multi-Room Persistence**: Deploying Clara to smart displays to provide a consistent wellness companion throughout the home.
